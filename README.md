  The goal of this plugin is to provide an easy way to explore resources in a kubernetes cluster and retrieve its details.

## üöÄ Usage

zjk8s must either be downloaded to the file system or configured with a remote URL within a zellij layout, such that zellij is able to download the plugin. The following configuration must be added to the layout, in which you'd like to use zjk8s.

```javascript
pane {
    plugin location="https://github.com/dj95/zjk8s/releases/latest/download/zjk8s.wasm" {
        kubernetes_context "k8s"

        selected_item_bg               "#737592"
        selected_col_bg                "#2a2b3e"
        selected_col_selected_item_bg  "#737592"
    }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In case you experience any crashes or issues, please in the first step try to clear the cache! (`$HOME/.cache/zellij/` for Linux, `$HOME/Library/Caches/org.Zellij-Contributors.Zellij/` on macOS)

When the layout and the plugin is started, it should display the namespaces, all resource types in the first namespace and all resources of the first resource type. For larger clusters, it might take a few seconds to load all resources. When everything is loaded, navigate with the arrow keys through the lists and columns. If you press `Enter` on a resource, it will display the details of the resource on the right.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Installation with nix flake

Add this repository to your inputs and then with the following overlay to your packages.
Then you are able to install and refer to it with `pkgs.zjk8s`. When templating the
config file, you can use `${pkgs.zjk8s}/bin/zjk8s.wasm` as the path.

```nix
  inputs = {
    # ...

    zjk8s = {
      url = "github:dj95/zjk8s";
    };
  };


  # define the outputs of this flake - especially the home configurations
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, zjstatus, ... }@inputs:
  let
    inherit (inputs.nixpkgs.lib) attrValues;

    overlays = with inputs; [
      # ...
      (final: prev: {
        zjk8s = zjk8s.packages.${prev.system}.default;
      })
    ];
```

## üöß Development

Make sure you have rust and the `wasm32-wasi` target installed. If using nix, you could utilize the nix-shell
in this repo for obtaining `cargo` and `rustup`. Then you'll only need to add the target with
`rustup target add wasm32-wasi`.

With the toolchain, simply build `zjk8s` with `cargo build`. Then you are able to run the example configuration
with `zellij -l plugin-dev-workspace.kdl` from the root of the repository.
